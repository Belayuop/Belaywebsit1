    Approach to
brain and spinal
cord tumors
Hanna Derebe(MD)
November 18,2025
Objectives
• Understand the unique pathophysiology of intracranial
and spinal neoplasms
• Differentiate between common primary and secondary
tumors. • Identify "red flag" symptoms and Localize a lesion based
on clinical signs and symptoms. • Approach to a patient with brain or spinal tumor
• Understand overview of management of CNS tumors
Introduction to brain tumors
• Definition: Neoplasms arising
from intracranial tissues and it’s
covering the meninges. • Special features of the brain
"Sanctuary Site“ include the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) which
poses challenges for drug
delivery and the "Closed Box":
The rigid cranium which means
small lesions can have profound
effects.
Neuroanatomy & Physiology
Review
• The Cranial Vault
• Lobar Functions
• Frontal: Executive function, motor control,
expressive language (Broca's area). • Temporal: Memory, hearing, receptive
language (Wernicke's area). • Parietal: Sensation, spatial awareness. • Occipital: Vision. • Cerebellum: Balance and coordination.
Epidemiology
• Primary Brain Tumors:Most Common Primary Tumors in
Adults: Meningioma (~39%)
• Metastatic Brain Tumors: More common than primary
tumors, occurring in 20-40% of cancer patients. Common
primary sites: Lung, Breast, Melanoma, Renal, Colorectal. • Most Common Malignant Primary Tumor: Glioblastoma.
Risk Factors:
Øionizing radiation (e.g., prior cranial radiotherapy). ØGenetic Syndromes
• Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and 2
• Tuberous Sclerosis
• Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) Disease
Øenvironmental factors
Pathophysiology
Monro-Kellie Doctrine:
The combined volume of
neuronal tissue, blood, and
CSF is constant. To
maintain homeostatic
intracranial pressure, any
increase or decrease in
one of these elements
leads to a reciprocal and
opposite change in the
others
• 1.Mass Effect & Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP)
Ø Direct Compression
Ø Vasogenic Edema: Disruption of the BBB by tumor vessels
leads to fluid leakage into the brain's extracellular space. Ø Blockage of CSF drainage
• Results in
• Initial compensation (CSF and venous blood displacement). • Decompensation leads to a rapid rise in ICP.
2. Focal Deficits & Seizures
ØFocal Neurological Deficits: Result from disruption of
specific functional areas .The nature of the deficit helps
localize the lesion. ØSeizures:
• Tumors irritate the surrounding cortex, creating an
epileptogenic focus. • Can be the first presenting symptom, especially with slow- growing tumors (e.g., low-grade glioma, meningioma). • A new-onset seizure in an adult should be throughly
investigated.
Overview of WHO
classification of nervous
system tumors
• 1. tumors of neuroepithelial tissue
• 2. tumors of cranial and paraspinal nerves
• 3. tumors of the meninges
• 4. lymphomas and hematopoietic neoplasms
• 5. germ cell tumors
• 6. tumors of the sellar region
• 7. metastatic tumors

Clinical Presentation
Clinical symptoms of Increased ICP:
ØHeadache: The most common symptom. "Red Flags"
features:
• Worse in the morning. • Exacerbated by coughing or the Valsalva maneuver and
may be temporarily relieved by vomiting
• New, persistent headache, especially after the age of 50 and
without a prior history. • Associated with nausea, vomiting, or neurological deficits. ØCognitive & Personality Changes: Subtle changes in
memory, concentration, or behavior, often noted by
family members first (frontal lobe tumors
ØFocal Neurological Deficits
• Frontal Lobe: Contralateral body weakness, expressive
(Broca's) aphasia. • Temporal Lobe: Receptive (Wernicke's) aphasia,
memory impairment, complex partial seizures. • Parietal Lobe: Contralateral sensory loss, spatial neglect. • Occipital Lobe: vision impairment
• Cerebellum: gait instability, difficulty maintaining
balance, nystagmus. • Brainstem: Cranial nerve palsies, altered consciousness.
ØSeizures
• In upto 26% of cases due to cortical irritation in the area
of the tumor. • Often focal in onset, may generalize secondarily. • Often the event that brings the patient to medical
attention. • Management of seizures is a key part of supportive care.
Physical examination
• The Neurological Examination: A Vital Diagnostic Tool
• A meticulous exam is crucial for localizing the lesion and
establishing a baseline. • Key Components:
• Mental Status Exam(GCS)
• Cranial Nerve Testing
• Motor System
• Cerebellar tests(rapid alternating movements)
• Sensory System (pinprick, vibration, proprioception). • Fundoscopy: To check for papilledema (a sign of increased
ICP).
Investigations
• Baseline work up-CBC,rbs,electrolyte,oft,pict
• Imaging : MRI as the Gold Standard
• Computed Tomography (CT):
• Excellent for initial evaluation in emergencies (fast, good
for detecting hemorrhage). • Can show mass effect and edema but is less sensitive than
MRI.
• Histopathological & Molecular Diagnosis: The
Definitive Answer is biopsy using histology (H&E
staining) and immunohistochemistry and Molecular
Analysis
Overview of common brain tumors
Supratentorial tumors
• Signs and symptoms
include: increased icp(direct
and due to edma),
progressive focal deficits,
headache, seizures, change
in mentation, symptoms
mimicking stroke. • in the special case of
pituitary tumors symptoms
include endocrine
disturbances and CSF leak
Infratentorial tumors
• Seizures are rare. • Presents with increased icp
due to blockage of CSF
drainage
• lesions in cerebellar may
cause: ataxia of the extremities,
dysmetria, intention Tremor,
broad based gait, truncal ataxia
• brainstem involvement usually
results in multiple cranial
nerve abnormalities, and
nystagmus.
Special considerations
Patients with Primary CNS Lymphoma (PCNSL)
• More common in immunocompromised individuals like
patients with HIV but also occurs in the
immunocompetent. • A rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma confined to the
CNS. • Treatment is chemotherapy-based.
• Pediatric Brain Tumors
• Among all childhood cancers, brain tumors are the
second only to leukemias hence the most common solid
pediatric tumor . • Tumors in children differ significantly from adults in type
and location. • Many of these tumors escape diagnosis until they are very
large in size due to the elasticity of the infant skull, the
adaptability of the developing nervous system to
compensate for deficits, and the difficulty in examining a
patient and inability to cooperate. • The most common presenting manifestations are
vomiting, arrest or regression of psychomotor
development, poor feeding/failure to thrive. They may
also present with seizures
Managment
• Treatment is always a balance between efficacy and
toxicity/neurological preservation. Surgical Management
• Goals of Surgery:
• Obtain a definitive diagnosis. • Reduce tumor mass (cytoreduction), which relieves ICP and
symptoms. • Improve the efficacy of adjuvant therapies
(radiation/chemo).
• Radiation Therapy
• Systemic Chemotherapy
• The Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Challenge: A major
obstacle that prevents many drugs from reaching the
brain. • Strategies: Use of small, lipid-soluble drugs that can
cross the BBB.
Supportive and Palliative Care
• Focuses on managing symptoms (pain, fatigue, nausea),
providing psychological and spiritual support
Neuro-rehabilitation: Maximizing Function and Quality
of Life
• A critical component of the treatment plan. • Physiotherapy: Addresses weakness, balance, and
mobility. • Speech and Language Pathology: Manages aphasia and
dysphagia (swallowing difficulties).
• Management of Complications
Cerebral Edema
• Corticosteroids (Dexamethasone): The mainstay of
treatment for vasogenic edema. • Side Effects: Use the lowest effective dose for the
shortest possible time. Long-term use can cause
hyperglycemia, myopathy, weight gain, insomnia, and
immunosuppression.
Seizures
• prophylactic antiepileptic should not be used routinely in
patients with newly diagnosed brain tumors
• In patients with brain tumors undergoing craniotomy,
prophylactic ASMs may be used and if there has been no
seizure, it is appropriate to taper off starting 1 week post- op.
Spinal cord tumors
• Definition: is an abnormal mass of
tissue due to uncontrolled growth of
cells with in or surrounding the the
spinal cord /spinal colomun. • They can be benign(non cancerous) or
malignant(cancerous).
Types of spinal tumors
A.primary tumors which originate from the spine itself
and its adjacent structures
B.secondary (metastatic)
• As the spine is well vascularized and has close
relationship with regional lymphatic and venous drainage
systems (especially Batson’s venous plexus), it is
generally susceptible to metastasis. • Metastatic tumors are most common (97%) tumors of the
spine. • The most common (70%) sites for spine metastasis are
thoracic and thoracolumbar spine.
• Most common causes of secondary(metastatic) tumors to the
spine
• Lung ca
• Breast ca
• Prostate ca
• Renal ca
• Thyroid ca
• Multiple myeloma
• Lymphoma
Ø Most secondary lesions are osteolytic (cause bony destruction)
Exceptions that may be osteoblastic:
● in men: prostate Ca is the most common
● in women: breast Ca is the most common
Anatomical Classification
• This classification is crucial
for determining the surgical
approach and predicting the
tumor type. • Spinal cord tumors are
primarily classified based on
their anatomical location as
A. Intramedullary
B. Extramedullary
C. Extradural
A. Intramedullary
• Comprises up to 5-10%
• Located within the substance of the spinal cord. • Most are malignant
• Common lesions include ependymomas , astrocytoma
and heamngioblastoma.
B. Extramedullary 
• Up to 60-70%
• Located within the dura but outside the spinal cord itself
• Affect spinal cord function by causing spinal cord
compression. • Most common lesions include Menengioma,
neurofibroma and schwanoma.
C. Extradural 
• Upto 25-30%
• Located outside the dura mater. • Most common causes are metastatic lesions.
Clinical Presentaion
Øthe most common and leading symptom is pain,with or
without traumatic event in the recent past and tenderness. This could be due to pathological fracture
ØThe pain that slowly starts, gradually increases, is usually
persistent at night and eventually disturbs the patient even
at rest is considered the most typical sign for spine
tumors. ØAn acute pain that starts without any trauma in a patient
without any previous symptom should also be considered
a pathological fracture.
ØCan also present with Radicular signs could also be as a
result of invasion or compression of the nerve root by the
tumor itself, and sometimes pathologic fractures could
make root irritation
ØWeakness and paralysis of the lower and less commonly
upper extremities with sensory level. ØNumbness, tingling, and a decreased sensation to pain
and temperature. ØSymptoms of primary malignancy
ØStiff neck or back
ØLoss of bladder and bowel function
ØScoliosis or other spinal deformities
ØConstitutional symptoms
Diagnosis
• History: Onset, duration, and progression of
symptoms.history of radiation, Presence of constitutional
symptoms like weight loss or fever may suggest
malignancy. • Neurological Examination:
• Motor: Assessment of muscle strength and tone. • Sensory: Mapping out the level of sensory loss. • Reflexes
Imaging
ØPlain radiographs must always take the first line. Can
identify nearly 80% of the benign tumors and some of
malignant tumors and characteristics of metastatic lesions
which can be osteoblastic, osteolytic or mixed.It can also
be used to screen for the primary lesions in metastatic
leasions
• CT is the more advantageous which is superior to plain
radiographs
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the Gold
statndard.
• Biopsy: Essential for obtaining a definitive histological
diagnosis, which guides further treatment and prognosis. This can sometimes be done as part of the surgical
resection. • Cytology and csf fluid examination.
Managment
A Multidisciplinary Approach
• The management of spinal cord tumors requires a
collaborative effort between neurosurgeons, oncologists,
radiation oncologists, and rehabilitation specialists. • Goals of Treatment:
• Preservation or improvement of neurological function. • Complete and safe tumor removal when possible. • Alleviation of pain. • Ensuring spinal stability.
